# Bitcoin Topology Simulation
This simulation was written as part of a Semester Thesis at the ETH ZÃ¼rich during my first semester in my Masters.

## use
```
cd src
source ./venv/bin/activate  # sh, bash, ksh, or zsh
python main.py -display True
```

Be aware that this code was written with Pycharm with an Anaconda environment. Thus, the plotting behaves slightly different there and the user is advised to use Pycharm with an Anaconda environment too if possible.

plots and all simulation data are being saved in a folder ```data\.``` on the same level as the ```bitcoinTopologySimulation\.``` folder is located

## legal
The code can be used by everyone under the MIT license.

## responsibility
If used be aware that this is research code and thus designed to fulfil the need of research only. The author takes no responsibility.
