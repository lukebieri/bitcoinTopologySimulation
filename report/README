This file briefly describes the thesis template of the Distributed Computing group at ETH Zurich.

The content of the thesis should be structured using the three commands \frontmatter, \mainmatter, and \appendix, which change the pagestyle and in particular the page numbering accordingly.

The template provides the \TODO{...} and \REMARK{...} commands to add annotations to the generated document.

The template provides the following theorem-like environments:
 - theorem, lemma, corollary, observation
 - definition, problem, assumption, example
 - claim, remark
 - proof
